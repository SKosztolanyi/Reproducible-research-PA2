##Synopsis
This report is created using Rstuio, knitr and ggplot2 packages in a R markdown file.
In this analysis I answer various questions about a dataset and make plots to visualise the answers.
The dataset as well as questions are provided by Coursera's course Reproducible Research, which is part of a Data Science Specialization by John Hopkins University.

The Dataset comes in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the course web site:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2

There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

## Preparing the environment

I will be showing all the code and plots in this document openly, therefore I want to set echo=TRUE value for the whole document:
```{r environment,echo=TRUE}
library(knitr)
require("knitr")
opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, results="hold")
```

I will be making the plots in ggplot2, so I can load the package:
```{r load}
library(ggplot2)
```

##Loading and Processing the Raw Data
I set working directory to the one where I donwloaded the file
```{r setwd}
setwd("C:/Users/stefan/Google Drive OldZZZ/Coursera/Data Science/Reproducible research")
```

I then manually extract the zip file with winrar software in the working folder

With this command I read the whole csv file into r and call the dataset "storm0"
(The file is quite big, so it takes time to load it.)
```{r first dataset}
storm0 = read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv")
str(storm0)

```

We can see, that there are 902297 observations of 37 variables. Just to remind you, the dataset spans from the year 1950 to year 2011, so 61 years in total. That should be enough, to firmly ground our analysis in this dataset.

##The Target
This dataset is big and we could analyze it for many hours, even days. But for our current purpose, we want to answer only a few specific questions. We are interested in the connection of various weathers types to public health and consequences of weather to economy.
This is how we formulate our questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

##Summary




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
